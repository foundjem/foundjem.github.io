# **Agentic AI Systems in Multi-Environment Settings**

### **1. Introduction to Agentic AI**
An **Agentic AI System** refers to an autonomous AI system that can sense, decide, and act in an environment to achieve specific goals. In **multi-environment settings**, these AI agents operate across diverse, dynamic, and often conflicting environments, requiring **adaptive decision-making, communication, and coordination**.


## **2. Key Characteristics of Agentic AI in Multi-Environment Systems**
1. **Autonomy** â€“ Operates independently with minimal human intervention.
2. **Adaptability** â€“ Adjusts behavior based on real-time environmental changes.
3. **Multi-Agent Coordination** â€“ Collaborates or competes with other agents.
4. **Distributed Decision-Making** â€“ Decentralized intelligence for resilience.
5. **Goal-Oriented Optimization** â€“ Maximizes rewards while minimizing risks.


## **3. Types of Multi-Environment Settings**
### **3.1. Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous Environments**
- **Homogeneous Environments**: AI agents operate in uniform conditions (e.g., cloud-based automation).
- **Heterogeneous Environments**: Agents interact in mixed conditions with different rules, constraints, and uncertainties (e.g., cyber-physical systems).

### **3.2. Static vs. Dynamic Environments**
- **Static Environments**: Rules and conditions remain constant (e.g., financial AI trading models).
- **Dynamic Environments**: Conditions evolve over time (e.g., self-driving cars in urban traffic).

### **3.3. Cooperative vs. Competitive Multi-Agent Environments**
- **Cooperative**: AI agents work together towards a shared goal (e.g., swarm robotics in disaster response).
- **Competitive**: AI agents compete against each other (e.g., adversarial cybersecurity AI).

### **3.4. Fully Observable vs. Partially Observable Environments**
- **Fully Observable**: AI agents have complete visibility (e.g., chess AI).
- **Partially Observable**: AI agents make decisions with limited information (e.g., autonomous drones in complex terrain).


## **4. Architectural Models for Multi-Environment AI Systems**
### **4.1. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**
- Agents learn optimal strategies through interaction and rewards.
- **Mathematical Model:**
  \[
  Q(s, a) = (1 - \alpha) Q(s, a) + \alpha [R + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a')]
  \]
  - \( Q(s, a) \): Expected reward for action \( a \) in state \( s \)
  - \( \alpha \): Learning rate
  - \( R \): Immediate reward
  - \( \gamma \): Discount factor for future rewards

### **4.2. Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDP)**
- Used in **multi-agent scenarios** with uncertainty.
- Each agent \( i \) has a policy \( \pi_i \) that maps local observations \( o_i \) to actions \( a_i \).
- **Mathematical Model:**
  \[
  \pi_i(o_i) = \arg \max_{a_i} \sum_{t} \gamma^t R_i(s_t, a_t)
  \]

### **4.3. Federated Learning for Distributed AI Agents**
- Agents **collaborate** by training models locally and sharing updates.
- **Mathematical Model:**
  \[
  w_{t+1} = w_t - \eta \nabla F(w_t)
  \]
  - \( w_t \): Model weights at time \( t \)
  - \( \eta \): Learning rate
  - \( \nabla F(w_t) \): Gradient of the loss function


## **5. Security and Trust in Agentic AI**
### **5.1. Adversarial AI Attacks**
- **Evasion Attacks**: Fooling agents using adversarial examples.
- **Poisoning Attacks**: Manipulating training data to corrupt decision-making.

### **5.2. Trust Models**
- Trust is modeled using **Bayesian belief networks**:
  \[
  P(T | E) = \frac{P(E | T) P(T)}{P(E)}
  \]
  where \( P(T | E) \) is the trust probability given evidence \( E \).


## **6. Real-World Applications of Agentic AI in Multi-Environment Systems**
1. **Autonomous Vehicles** â€“ Navigate in **dynamic, multi-agent** urban traffic.
2. **Cybersecurity AI** â€“ Detect threats in **partially observable** network environments.
3. **Healthcare AI** â€“ **Federated learning** for personalized medicine.
4. **Financial AI Trading** â€“ **Reinforcement learning-based** market strategies.
5. **Smart Grid Energy Management** â€“ Adaptive **multi-agent** optimization.


## **7. Conclusion**
Agentic AI in multi-environment settings requires:
- **Adaptive learning models** (MARL, Dec-POMDP).
- **Distributed decision-making** (Federated AI).
- **Security mechanisms** (Trust models, Adversarial AI).
These **autonomous systems** will drive the future of **self-learning, secure, and efficient AI ecosystems**. ðŸš€



### **1. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**
This example implements **Q-learning** for two agents navigating a grid environment.

#### **Environment:**
- A **5x5 grid** where two agents must reach their respective goals.
- **Reward:** +10 for reaching the goal, -1 for illegal moves.
- **Agents learn simultaneously using Q-learning**.

#### **Code:**
```python
import numpy as np
import random

# Environment settings
GRID_SIZE = 5
ACTIONS = ["UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"]
ACTION_MAP = {"UP": (-1, 0), "DOWN": (1, 0), "LEFT": (0, -1), "RIGHT": (0, 1)}

# Agents start at random positions, goals at fixed points
AGENT_1_GOAL = (4, 4)
AGENT_2_GOAL = (0, 0)

# Q-tables for agents
Q_agent1 = np.zeros((GRID_SIZE, GRID_SIZE, len(ACTIONS)))
Q_agent2 = np.zeros((GRID_SIZE, GRID_SIZE, len(ACTIONS)))

# Hyperparameters
alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
gamma = 0.9  # Discount factor
epsilon = 0.1  # Exploration rate
episodes = 5000

# Function to get next position
def move(position, action):
    new_position = (position[0] + ACTION_MAP[action][0], position[1] + ACTION_MAP[action][1])
    if 0 <= new_position[0] < GRID_SIZE and 0 <= new_position[1] < GRID_SIZE:
        return new_position
    return position  # Invalid moves stay in place

# Training loop
for episode in range(episodes):
    agent1_pos = (random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1), random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1))
    agent2_pos = (random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1), random.randint(0, GRID_SIZE - 1))

    while agent1_pos != AGENT_1_GOAL or agent2_pos != AGENT_2_GOAL:
        for agent, Q_table, goal in [(1, Q_agent1, AGENT_1_GOAL), (2, Q_agent2, AGENT_2_GOAL)]:
            pos = agent1_pos if agent == 1 else agent2_pos
            if pos == goal:
                continue

            # Choose action (Îµ-greedy)
            if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
                action = random.choice(ACTIONS)
            else:
                action = ACTIONS[np.argmax(Q_table[pos[0], pos[1], :])]

            # Move agent
            new_pos = move(pos, action)
            reward = 10 if new_pos == goal else -1

            # Update Q-table
            Q_table[pos[0], pos[1], ACTIONS.index(action)] += alpha * (
                reward + gamma * np.max(Q_table[new_pos[0], new_pos[1], :]) - Q_table[pos[0], pos[1], ACTIONS.index(action)]
            )

            # Update agent position
            if agent == 1:
                agent1_pos = new_pos
            else:
                agent2_pos = new_pos

print("Training complete! Agents have learned optimal paths.")
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **Two agents learn independently** using **Q-learning**.
- **Grid-based movement**, avoiding invalid moves.
- **Goal-oriented reinforcement learning**.


### **2. Game Theory-Based Multi-Agent Decision Making**
This example implements a **Prisoner's Dilemma** game between two AI agents.

```python
import nashpy as nash
import numpy as np

# Define the payoff matrix for Prisoner's Dilemma
P1_payoffs = np.array([[-1, -3], [0, -2]])  # Row player (Agent 1)
P2_payoffs = np.array([[-1, 0], [-3, -2]])  # Column player (Agent 2)

# Create a game using Nashpy
game = nash.Game(P1_payoffs, P2_payoffs)

# Compute Nash Equilibria
equilibria = list(game.support_enumeration())

# Display Nash Equilibrium Strategies
print("Nash Equilibria (Mixed Strategies):")
for eq in equilibria:
    print(f"Agent 1 Strategy: {eq[0]}, Agent 2 Strategy: {eq[1]}")
```

#### **Explanation:**
- Models two **self-interested agents** choosing **cooperate (C) or defect (D)**.
- **Nash equilibrium** represents the **optimal mixed strategies**.



### **3. Decentralized Multi-Agent System with Communication**
A **swarm of agents** moves towards a goal using **decentralized coordination**.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Environment settings
NUM_AGENTS = 10
GOAL = np.array([5, 5])
MOVE_STEP = 0.5
COMMUNICATION_RANGE = 2.0
ITERATIONS = 50

# Initialize agent positions randomly
agents = np.random.rand(NUM_AGENTS, 2) * 10

def move_towards_goal(agent, neighbors):
    # Compute average neighbor position (consensus rule)
    if len(neighbors) > 0:
        avg_pos = np.mean(neighbors, axis=0)
        move_direction = avg_pos - agent
    else:
        move_direction = GOAL - agent
    
    return agent + MOVE_STEP * (move_direction / np.linalg.norm(move_direction))

# Simulation
positions = [agents.copy()]
for _ in range(ITERATIONS):
    new_positions = []
    for agent in agents:
        neighbors = [other for other in agents if np.linalg.norm(agent - other) < COMMUNICATION_RANGE]
        new_positions.append(move_towards_goal(agent, neighbors))
    
    agents = np.array(new_positions)
    positions.append(agents.copy())

# Plot results
positions = np.array(positions)
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
for i in range(NUM_AGENTS):
    plt.plot(positions[:, i, 0], positions[:, i, 1], marker='o', linestyle='-')

plt.scatter(GOAL[0], GOAL[1], marker="X", color="red", s=100, label="Goal")
plt.xlabel("X Position")
plt.ylabel("Y Position")
plt.title("Swarm Agents Moving Towards Goal")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **10 agents** move towards a **goal** using **local communication**.
- **Consensus-based movement** makes it **robust** to missing data.
- Models **swarm robotics, decentralized AI, and self-organizing systems**.


### **4. Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Traffic Control**
A **multi-agent reinforcement learning** setup where **traffic lights learn** optimal control.

```python
import numpy as np
import random

# Environment setup
ACTIONS = ["RED", "GREEN"]
TRAFFIC_STATES = ["LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH"]
Q_table = np.zeros((len(TRAFFIC_STATES), len(ACTIONS)))

# Learning parameters
alpha = 0.1
gamma = 0.9
epsilon = 0.1
episodes = 5000

# Reward function (based on congestion reduction)
def reward(state, action):
    if state == "HIGH" and action == "GREEN":
        return 10  # Best action
    elif state == "LOW" and action == "RED":
        return 5  # Minor reward
    else:
        return -5  # Wrong action penalty

# Training
for _ in range(episodes):
    state_idx = random.randint(0, len(TRAFFIC_STATES) - 1)
    
    # Choose action (Îµ-greedy)
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        action_idx = random.randint(0, len(ACTIONS) - 1)
    else:
        action_idx = np.argmax(Q_table[state_idx, :])
    
    # Get reward
    r = reward(TRAFFIC_STATES[state_idx], ACTIONS[action_idx])
    
    # Update Q-table
    Q_table[state_idx, action_idx] += alpha * (
        r + gamma * np.max(Q_table[state_idx, :]) - Q_table[state_idx, action_idx]
    )

print("Multi-Agent Traffic Control Training Complete!")
print("Final Q-Table:")
print(Q_table)
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **Traffic signals** learn **optimal switching** using **Q-learning**.
- **Adaptive control** based on **real-time congestion**.
